# Digesting Documentation
## Module 4.1 Learning from Documentation
## What I did
```
hacker@man~learning-from-documentation:~$ /challenge/challenge --giveflag
Correct argument! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{A8OJP8IKYb5_lBbgLdlp06io_iG.QX0ITO0wSN3kjNzEzW}
```
## Flag
pwn.college{A8OJP8IKYb5_lBbgLdlp06io_iG.QX0ITO0wSN3kjNzEzW}

## What I learned
In this challenge, I learned the importance of reading and understanding program documentation. Many command-line programs require specific arguments to function correctly, and knowing which argument to use can completely change the programâ€™s behavior.

## Module 4.2 Learning Complex Usage
## What I did
```
hacker@man~learning-complex-usage:~$ /challenge/challenge --printfile /flag
Correct argument! Here is the /flag file:
pwn.college{g7Y2Csh2v8Mbbq4Xc1C5Pofjgm7.QX1ITO0wSN3kjNzEzW}

```
## Flag
pwn.college{g7Y2Csh2v8Mbbq4Xc1C5Pofjgm7.QX1ITO0wSN3kjNzEzW}

## What I learned
In this challenge, I learned about commands that take arguments to their arguments. The program /challenge/challenge required the --printfile argument, and that argument itself needed a file path to specify which file to print.

## Module 4.3 Reading Manuals
## What I did
```
hacker@man~reading-manuals:~$ man challenge
hacker@man~reading-manuals:~$ /challenge/challenge --eiwzxj 775
Correct usage! Your flag: pwn.college{QGeiG_-MwzQxSRF7Aj75tToZcx3.QX0EDO0wSN3kjNzEzW}

```
## Flag
pwn.college{QGeiG_-MwzQxSRF7Aj75tToZcx3.QX0EDO0wSN3kjNzEzW}

## What I learned
In this challenge, I learned how to identify and run executable files by their full path. By listing the contents of the /challenge directory, I determined that the file named challenge was the program to run.

## Module 4.4 Searching Manuals
## What I did
```
hacker@man~searching-manuals:~$ man challenge
hacker@man~searching-manuals:~$ /challenge/challenge --kva 
Initializing...
Correct usage! Your flag: pwn.college{MhnRhh7tVzgMQmmgyT56UorstyL.QX1EDO0wSN3kjNzEzW}
```
## Flag
pwn.college{MhnRhh7tVzgMQmmgyT56UorstyL.QX1EDO0wSN3kjNzEzW}

## What I learned
In this challenge, I learned how to locate and run an executable using its full path. By inspecting the /challenge directory, I identified the challenge file as the program to run. Reading the man page taught me how to supply the correct argument (--eiwzxj 775) so that the program would reveal the flag.

## Module 4.5 Searching for Manuals
## What I did
```
hacker@man~searching-for-manuals:~$ man man
hacker@man~searching-for-manuals:~$ man wxysrjgoaw
hacker@man~searching-for-manuals:~$ /challenge/challenge --wxysrj 477
Correct usage! Your flag: pwn.college{4wY7PxYHyWsQPVNr-jgB7oRa-NH.QX2EDO0wSN3kjNzEzW}

```
## Flag
pwn.college{4wY7PxYHyWsQPVNr-jgB7oRa-NH.QX2EDO0wSN3kjNzEzW}

## What I learned
In this challenge, I learned how to search for and use hidden manpages to understand how to run a command correctly. I also learned that commands can require specific options and numeric arguments, and reading the documentation carefully is essential to execute them properly and retrieve the flag.
